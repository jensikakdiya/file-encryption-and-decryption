# file-encryption-and-decryption

The File Encryption and Decryption Application is a software tool designed to provide users with a secure way to encrypt and decrypt their sensitive files using encryption algorithms. This project aims to create a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to protect their confidential data from unauthorized access by encrypting it with a strong encryption key. Users can also decrypt the encrypted files when needed.
